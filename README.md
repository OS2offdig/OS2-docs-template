# Documentation template for OS2 projects

## How to use this template for documenting your OS2 project

## üë∑ Maintainers guide
As a part of the documentation maintainer team... 
1. Start by [creating a documentation repository in your project, from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), including only the main branch.

2. Use the repositorys built-in [issues feature](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to manage all changes, task and suggestions for improvements. [Organize your work in Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) and [use task lists to break down larger documentation work](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists). Use [labels to prioritize and classify your issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) to maintain an overview on what needs to be done.

3. Stay on top of proposed changes to the documentation by [reviewing and merging Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) to your documentation repository,

Content guide:

Documentation in OS2 products must follow the documentation criteria from the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)

1. [Document your codebase objectives](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-codebase-objectives.html)
2. [Document the Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-the-code.html)

Following these criteria not only opens up our codebase and fosters collaboration and transparency, but also encourages more organizations to use and adapt our open source products.
