# Documentation template for OS2 projects

## How to use this template for documenting your OS2 project

## üë∑ Maintainers guide

*In OS2 projects the maintainer team is the group of individuals assigned to oversee the development, quality, and community engagement of the documentation project.*

# Setup

1. Start by [creating a documentation repository in your project, from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), including only the main branch.
3. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). The documentation site is now live!
4. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages to your docs.

#### Maintenance

1. Use the repositorys built-in [issues feature](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to manage all changes, task and suggestions for improvements.

    - Organize your work in [Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
    - [Use task lists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists) to break down larger documentation work into manageble pieces.
    - [Assign labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)  to prioritize and classify your issues and maintain an overview on what needs to be done.
    - Document suggestions and improvements by [raising issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and describing what needs to be fixed, describe the user stories and potential delivered values.

2. Stay on top of proposed changes to the documentation by [reviewing and merging Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) to your documentation repository,

## üßë‚Äçü¶∞ Contributors Guide

*Contributors to the documentation can be project managers, technical editors, developers and end-users.*

1. Document suggestions and improvements by [raising issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and describing what needs to be fixed, describe the user stories and potential delivered values.
2. Participate in issue discussions to help reach the correct resolutions. If you have the required knowledge about a part of the project, suggest yourself as an [assignee to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users#about-issue-and-pull-request-assignees).
3. Collaborate on documentation branches with issues assigned to you by the maintainers.

Content guide:

Documentation in OS2 products must follow the documentation criteria from the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)

1. [Document your codebase objectives](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-codebase-objectives.html)
2. [Document the Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-the-code.html)

Following these criteria not only opens up our codebase and fosters collaboration and transparency, but also encourages more organizations to use and adapt our open source products.
