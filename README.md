# Documentation template for OS2 projects

## üèóÔ∏è Getting started 

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll][Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs][Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages][GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

[Browse documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

Documentation in OS2 products must follow the documentation criteria from the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)

1. [Document your codebase objectives](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-codebase-objectives.html)
2. [Document the Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-the-code.html)

Following these criteria not only opens up our codebase and fosters collaboration and transparency, but also encourages more organizations to use and adapt our open source products.
