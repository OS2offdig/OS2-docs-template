# Contributing to OS2 Documentation

Contributors to the documentation can be project managers, technical editors, developers, and end-users. We welcome contributions that help improve our documentation and ensure it meets the needs of our community.

To open up our codebases and fosters collaboration and transparency and encourage more organizations to use and adapt our open source products OS2 follows the documentation criteria from the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)

- [Document your codebase objectives](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-codebase-objectives.html) 
- [Document the Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-the-code.html)
- [Document codebase Maturity]

## How to Contribute

1. Start by writing a README following the simple criteria in the above guides from Standard for Public Code. For at fast and simple way to accomplish this, you can fill out the placeholders in the PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md and [rename it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/renaming-a-file) to README.md, replacing the Quick start guide for this template with your projects information. 

2. Document further suggestions and improvements by [raising issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and describing what needs to be fixed, describe the user stories and potential delivered values.
3. Participate in issue discussions to help reach the correct resolutions. If you have the required knowledge about a part of the project, suggest yourself as an [assignee to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users#about-issue-and-pull-request-assignees).
4. Collaborate on documentation branches with issues assigned to you by the maintainers.
